# budhud-compiler

> A tool to compile away as many #base and #include directives as possible. Designed for [budhud](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud).

## Usage

> ðŸ’¡ This tool currently only takes a single file as input. If you need to compile multiple files, consider writing a shell script that iterates over them and invokes `budhud-compiler` on each of them.

1. Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/alvancamp/budhud-compiler/releases/latest).
	- At this time, only Windows builds are provided. If you need builds for other platforms, consider building the program from source.

	  -w, --watch                    (Default: false) If true, the input file or directory will be watched for changes and automatically recompiled to the specified output path.
